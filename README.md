# SETTE Results

The repository contains our results on comparing several test input generator tools by executing them on a predefined set of code snippets (see `sette-snippets` repository).

For each experiment we uploaded input and configuration given to the tools, and the generated outputs (logs, test files...).

The repository currently contains the following results:

* 2014-10-23: one execution of CATG, EvoSuite, jPET, Pex and SPF tools
* 2015-09-25: three experiments
 * executions with 30 sec time limit (10 repetitions) on CATG, EvoSuite, jPET, Pex, Randoop and SPF
 * variable time limit (15s, 45s, 60s, 300s) experiments with EvoSuite and Randoop
 * mutation analysis of the tests generated by CATG, EvoSuite and SPF
