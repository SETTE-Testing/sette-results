In order to save disk space, all the results are 7zipped using the best comperession level. Since the majority of the files contain Java source code, XML data and traditional text, the unzipped size might be even 80-100 times greater than the size of the archive.

7-Zip can be obtained from http://www.7-zip.org/ for free.
