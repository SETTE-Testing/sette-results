# SETTE Results 2015-09-25

The results of three sets of experiments can be found in this folder:

* `01-fixed-30sec-time-limit`: executions with 30 sec time limit (10 repetitions) on CATG, EvoSuite, jPET, Pex, Randoop and SPF
* `02-variable-time-limit`: variable time limit (15s, 45s, 60s, 300s) experiments with EvoSuite and Randoop (10 repetitions)
* `03-mutation-analysis`: mutation analysis of the tests generated by CATG, EvoSuite and SPF

## Contents

Each folder contains a

* CSV with the extracted and cleaned data from the experiments,
* a 7z file with all the input and output of the experiments, for the Java-based tools this includes
 * `build`: compiled snippet and tests files
 * `runner-out`: logs and output of the SETTE framework running the test generator tool (stdout, coverage reports...)
 * `snippet-src`: snippet codes used in the given experiment
 * `test`: tests generated by the tool in JUnit format
 * `build.xml`: building the snippets and the tests with Apache Ant

## Compression (7z)

In order to save disk space, all the results are 7zipped using the best comperession level. Since the majority of the files contain Java source code, XML data and traditional text, the unzipped size might be even 80-100 times greater than the size of the archive.

7-Zip can be obtained from http://www.7-zip.org/ for free.
