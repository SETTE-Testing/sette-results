# SETTE results for sette-snippets-performance time with variable time limit

Experimental results for comparing 5 test input generator tools with 4 different time limits: 15 seconds, 45 seconds, 60 seconds and 300 seconds. Experiments were performed on a subset of the core snippets (129 of 300).

For every tool and time limit pair, the experiments were repeated 10 times (called runs).

Be aware that the uncompressed results for Randoop are very large, approximately 15 GB.
