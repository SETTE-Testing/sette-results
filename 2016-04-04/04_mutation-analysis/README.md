# Mutation analysis results

Mutation analysis for the 6x10 runs of the `sette-snippets` project with 30 second time limit for 6 test input generator tools. The analysis was carried out using the Major mutation framework version 1.1.7 (http://mutation-testing.org/) for all tools (the tests generated by IntelliTest has been transformed to Java in order to perform analysis on the same platform and mutant set).
