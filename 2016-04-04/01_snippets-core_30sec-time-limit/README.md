# SETTE results for sette-snippets with 30s time limit

Experimental results for comparing 6 test input generator tools using the SETTE framework. Each tool was directed to generate tests for a code base (`sette-snippets`) containing 300 methods representing the important language features of Java/.NET. The outcome of the generation and the resulting tests were saved, then several metrics were measured (e.g. coverage achieved by the tests) in order to gain insights about the current capabilities of the tools. 

For every tool, the experiments were repeated 10 times (called runs).
