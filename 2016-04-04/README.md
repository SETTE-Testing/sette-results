# SETTE Results 2016-04-04

The results of four sets of experiments can be found in this folder:
* `01_snippets-core_30sec-time-limit`: executions with 30 seconds time limit (10 repetitions) on CATG, EvoSuite, IntelliTest, jPET, Randoop and SPF
* `02_snippets-performance-time_variable-time-limit`: variable time limit (15s, 45s, 60s, 300s) experiments on a subset of the above snippets (10 repetitions)
* `03_snippets-extra_30sec-time-limit`: executions with 30 seconds time limit (10 repetitions) using more difficult snippets on the Java tools
* `04_mutation-analysis`: mutation analysis of the 30 second time limit tests generated by the 6 tools

## Contents of the compressed files

Each folder contains a 7z file with all the input and output of the experiments; for the Java-based tools this includes
 * `build`: compiled snippet and test files
 * `runner-out`: logs and output of the SETTE framework running the test generator tool (stdout, coverage reports...)
 * `snippet-src`: snippet codes used in the given experiment
 * `test`: tests with the generated test inputs in JUnit format
 * `build.xml`: building the snippets and the tests with Apache Ant
